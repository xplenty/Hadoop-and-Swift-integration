# OpenStack&trade; Swift Filesystem Support for Apache&trade; Hadoop&reg;

This module enables Apache Hadoop applications -including MapReduce jobs,
read and write data to and from instances of the OpenStack Swift object store.

## Features

* Read and write of data stored in a Swift object store
* Support of a pseudo-hierachical file system (directories, subdirectoriesand files)
* Standard filesystem operations: create, delete, mkdir, ls, mv, stat
* Can act as a source of data in a MapReduce job, or a sink.
* Support for multiple OpenStack services, and multiple containers from a singleservice.
* Supports in-cluster and remote access to Swift data.
* Supports OpenStack Keystone authentication with password or token.
* Released under the Apache Software License
* Tested against the Hadoop 3.x and 1.x branches, against multiple public OpenStack clusters: Rackspace US, Rackspace UK, HP Cloud.
* Tested against private openstack clusters, including scalability tests of large file uploads.



## Using

## Concepts: services and containers

OpenStack swift is an *Object Store*; also known as a *blobstore*. It stores
arbitrary binary objects by name in a *container*. 


The Hadoop Swift filesytem library adds another concept, the *service*, which defines which Swift 
blobstore hosts a continer -and how to connect to it.

### Containers and Objects


Containers are created by users with accounts on the Swift filestore, and hold *objects*.

* Objects can be zero bytes long, or they can contain data.
* Objects in the container can be up to 5GB; there is a special support for larger files than this, which merges multiple objects in to one.
* Each object is referenced by it's *name*. An object is named by its full name, such as `this-is-an-object-name`.
* You can use any characters in an object name that can be 'URL-encoded'; the maximum length of a name is 1034 characters -after URL encoding.
* Names can have / charcters in them, which are used to create the illusion of a directory structure. For example `dir/dir2/name`. Even though this looks like a directory, *it is still just a name*. There is no requirement to have any entries in the container called `dir` or `dir/dir2` 
* That said. if the container has zero-byte objects that look like directory names above other objects, they can pretend to be directories. Continuing the example, a 0-byte object called `dir` would tell clients that it is a directory while `dir/dir2` or  `dir/dir2/name` were present. This creates an illusion of containers holding a filesystem.

Client applications talk to Swift over HTTP or HTTPS, reading, writing and deleting objects using standard HTTP operations (GET, PUT and DELETE, respectively). There is also a COPY operation, that creates a new object in the container, with a new name, containing the old data. There is no rename operation itself, objects need to be copied -then the original entry deleted.

The Swift Filesystem is *eventually consistent*: an operation on an object may not be immediately visible to that client, or other clients. This is a consequence of the goal of the filesystem: to span a set of machines, across multiple datacentres, in such a way that the data can still be available when many of them fail. (In contrast, the Hadoop HDFS filesystem is *immediately consistent*, but it does not span datacenters.)

Eventual consistency can cause surprises for client applications that expect immediate consistency: after an object is deleted or overwritten, the object may still be visible -or the old data still retrievable. The Swift Filesystem client for Apache Hadoop attempts to handle this, in conjunction with the MapReduce engine, but there may be still be occasions when eventual consistency causes suprises.

### Services

The Swift Filesystem client for Apache Hadoop is designed to work with  multiple Swift object stores, both public  and private. This allows the  client to work
with different clusters, reading and writing data to and from either of them. 

It can also work with the same object stores using multiple login details.

Both these features are achieved by one basic concept: using a service name
in the URI referring to a swift filesystem, and looking up all the connection
and login details for that specific service. Different service names
can be defined in the Hadoop XML configuration file, so defining different clusters,
or providing different login details for the same object store(s).



# Working with Swift Object Stores in Hadoop


### Filesystem URIs

Hadoop uses URIs to refer to files within a filesystem. Some common examples are:

    local://etc/hosts
    hdfs://cluster1/users/example/data/set1
    hdfs://cluster2.example.org:8020/users/example/data/set1
The Swift Filesystem Client adds a new URL type `swift`. In a Swift Filesystem URL, the hostname part of a URL identifies the container and the service to work with; the path the name of the object. Here are some examples

    swift://container.rackspace/my-object.csv
    swift://data.hpcloud/data/set1
    swift://dmitry.privatecloud/out/results

In the last two examples, the paths look like directories: it is not, they are simply the objects named `data/set1` and `out/results` respectively. 

## Installing

The `hadoop-swift` JAR must be on the classpath of the Hadoop program trying to talk to the Swift service. If installed in the classpath of the Hadoop MapReduce service, then all programs started by the MR engine will pick up the JAR automatically. This is the easiest way to give all Hadoop jobs access to Swift.

Alternatively, the JAR can be included as one of the JAR files that an application uses. This lets the Hadoop jobs work with a Swift object store even if the Hadoop cluster is not pre-configured for this.

Other applications may use the Swift Filesystem library, by way of the Hadoop filesystem APIs. This allows programs which interact with a Hadoop cluster to also read and write data in a Swift object store.

## Configuring

To talk to a swift service, you must provide:

1. The URL defining the container and the service.
1. In the cluster/job configuration, the login details of that service.

Multiple service definitions can co-exist in the same configuration file: just use different names for them.

#### Example: Rackspace US, in-cluster access using API key

This service definition is for use in a Hadoop cluster deployed within rackspace's
infrastructure.

    <property>
      <name>fs.swift.service.rackspace.auth.url</name>
      <value>https://auth.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0/tokens</value>
      <description>Rackspace US (multiregion)</description>
    </property>

    <property>
      <name>fs.swift.service.rackspace.username</name>
      <value>user4</value>
    </property>

    <property>
      <name>fs.swift.service.rackspace.region</name>
      <value>DFW</value>
    </property>

    <property>
      <name>fs.swift.service.rackspace.apikey</name>
      <value>fe806aa86dfffe2f6ed8</value>
    </property>

Here the API key visible in the account settings API keys page is used to log in.
No property for public/private access -the default is to use the private
endpoint for Swift operations.

This configuration also selects one of the regions, DFW, for its data.

A reference to this service would use the `rackspace` service name:

    swift://hadoop-container.rackspace/


#### Example: Rackspace UK: remote access with password authentication

This connects to Rackspace's UK ("LON") datacenter.

    <property>
      <name>fs.swift.service.rackspaceuk.auth.url</name>
      <value>https://lon.identity.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0/tokens</value>
      <description>Rackspace UK</description>
    </property>

    <property>
      <name>fs.swift.service.rackspaceuk.username</name>
      <value>user4</value>
    </property>

    <property>
      <name>fs.swift.service.rackspaceuk.password</name>
      <value>insert-password-here/value>
    </property>

    <property>
      <name>fs.swift.service.rackspace.public</name>
      <value>true</value>
    </property>

This is a public access point connection, using a password over an API key.

A reference to this service would use the `rackspaceuk` service name:

    swift://hadoop-container.rackspaceuk/

Because the public endpoint is used, if this service definition is used within the London datacenter, all accesses will be billed at the public upload/download rates, *irrespective of where the Hadoop cluster is*.



#### Example: HP cloud service definition


    <property>
      <name>fs.swift.service.hpcloud.auth.url</name>
      <value>https://region-a.geo-1.identity.hpcloudsvc.com:35357/v2.0/tokens
      </value>
      <description>HP Cloud</description>
    </property>

    <property>
      <name>fs.swift.service.hpcloud.username</name>
      <value>FE806AA86DFFFE2F6ED8</value>
    </property>

    <property>
      <name>fs.swift.service.hpcloud.password</name>
      <value>secret-password-goes-here</value>
    </property>

    <property>
      <name>fs.swift.service.hpcloud.public</name>
      <value>true</value>
    </property>

A reference to this service would use the `hpcloud` service name:

    swift://hadoop-container.hpcloud/


## Troubleshooting

### Class not found exception



### Failure to Authenticate

Check the auth URL through `curl` or your browser

### Timeout connecting to the Swift Service

This happens if the client application is running outside an OpenStack cluster,
where it does not have access to the private hostname/IP address for filesystem
operations. Set the public flag to true -but remember to set it to false
for use in-cluster.

## Warnings

1. Do not share your login details with anyone, which means do not log the details, or check the XML configuration files into any revision control system to which you do not have exclusive access.
1. Similarly, no use your real account details in any documentation.
1. Do not use the public service endpoint from within an OpenStack cluster, as it will run up large bills.
1. Remember: it's not a real filesystem or hierarchical directory structure. Some operations (directory rename and delete) take time and are not atomic or isolated from other operations taking place.
1. Append is not supported.
1. Unix-style permissions are not supported. All accounts with write access to a repository have unlimited access; the same goes for those with read access.
1. In the public clouds, do not make the containers public unless you are happy with anyone reading your data, and are prepared to pay the costs of their downloads.

## Limits

* Maximum length of an object path: 1024 characters
* Maximum size of a binary object: no absolute limit. Files > 5GB are partitioned into separate files in the native filesystem, and merged during retrieval.
